# Android Introduction To Reactive Programming â€“ RxJava, RxAndroid.
This project covers basics to advanced topics in RxJava and RxAndroid. Start with basic theoretical explanation of few terms you come across in reactive programming and later get on to few code examples.
## Requirements
* Knowledge of Java or Kotlin. 
* Experience with Android. Preferably 6 months or more. 
## Description.
### What is Reactive Programming.
Reactive Programming is basiclly event-based asynchorous programming. It has a lot of Data Stream which excuting simultaneously and It will emmit data. Observers which are subscribed to Oservable and Observer will reveice data which emmiting by Observable.
An advantage of asynchorous approach is every task which will run on its own thread. They will excute simultaneously.
### What is RxJava
It is a library that composes asynchronous events by following Observer Pattern. You can create asyncbronous data stream on any thread, transform the data and comsumed it by an Observer on any thread.
The library provides a lot of Operators which have many benefits.
Examples: 
* [Map](http://reactivex.io/documentation/operators/map.html).
* [FlatMap](http://reactivex.io/documentation/operators/flatmap.html).
* [Concat](http://reactivex.io/documentation/operators/concat.html).
* [Merge](http://reactivex.io/documentation/operators/merge.html).
* [Sum](http://reactivex.io/documentation/operators/sum.html).
* [Average](http://reactivex.io/documentation/operators/average.html)
